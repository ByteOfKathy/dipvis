Tournament Director's User Guide
--------------------------------

Before You Start
----------------

You're going to need an account on a site running the software.
The site operator needs to give you the appropriate permissions.
Throughout this document, we'll assume the site is https://example.com/.

Concepts
--------

Most of this should be fairly familiar, but there are some subtleties.
Things will be more obvious if you have a good understanding of these concepts.

A Player is a person who plays Diplomacy.
A Tournament is an event where people play Diplomacy competitively.
A Tournament consists of a number of Rounds, each of which has a number of Games.
Each Game is played with a GameSet (e.g. the Avalon Hill edition).

When Players register to play in a Tournament, this is represented by a
TournamentPlayer. When Players are present at roll call for a particular Round,
this is represented by a RoundPlayer. A Player playing a particular Game is
represented by a GamePlayer (note that the system doesn't currently support
replacement players - each Great Power in a Game has exactly one GamePlayer).

Games are scored using some GameScoringSystem (the system has support for all
the systems commonly used in North America). Scores for Games in a Round are
combined using a RoundScoringSystem. This only matters if you have players
playing multiple Games in a Round. The only option here is currently "best
game counts", meaning that each player gets the score for their best Game
in that Round. Similarly, Round scores get combined using a TournamentScoringSystem.
The system currently support "best 2 rounds", "best 3 rounds", and "best 4 rounds".
This allows you to have a "drop round" or to include all round scores.

The system also knows about SupplyCentres, CentreCounts, and DrawProposals, all
of which should be fairly self-explanatory.

Finally, it reads background information from the World Diplomacy Database and
stores it as PlayerAwards, PlayerGameResults, PlayerRankings, and PlayerTournamentRankings,
but you shouldn't need to worry about those at all.

The final concept is a SeederBias. This is used to guide the game seeding algorithm.
Essentially it tells the system to pretend that two TournamentPlayers have already
played a certain number of Games against each other this Tournament. Because the
game seeding algorithm tries to minimise the number of times each pair of Players
play each other within a Tournament, this will tend to keep those players apart.
It is intended for use when you have family members that you would prefer not to
end up at the same board.

Creating Your Tournament
------------------------

Start out at https://example.com/admin/tournament/tournament/add.
Give the tournament a name (the year will automatically be appended), dates, and
pick a TournamentScoringSystem and RoundScoringSystem. Decide whether you want the
system to seed the games or not, how Great Powers will be assigned, and what you're
going to tell players about failed DrawProposals.

Next come some items to control how the site will treat the Tournament. Make
yourself a Manager (you can add others too if you like), and decide whether to
publish the Tournament on the site. Unpublished Tournaments will only be visible
to users with accounts on the site, so it's a good idea to keep it unpublished
while you're getting everything set up. You might not want to publish it at all,
or only to publish it after the Tournament is over. Keep the Tournament Editable
until it's over and all the data has been entered.

Next you can add Rounds. For each one, you need to specify the start and end times and dates,
and the scoring system used for games in that Round (most Tournaments will use the
same scoring system for every round, but the system supports deviations from that).
You also need to decide whether Draws in the Round include all survivors (DIAS).

That's all you need to do here. You can also add TournamentPlayers from this page,
but adding too many at a time can cause problems. I recommend adding them later.

Scroll all the way to the bottom to find the "Save" button.

Now your Tournament has its own page on the site. Let's assume it's
https://example.com/tournaments/42/.

Registering Players
-------------------

The tournament page will list the number of players currently registered near the
top of the page. This is a link to the Tournament Players page at
https://example.com/tournaments/42/players/, where you will see them listed and
you can add and remove them.

Unregistering a player is as simple as clicking the button by their name. Note, though,
that the system will get very confused if you unregister a player who has already
played any games. Once the Tournament is underway, you're probably best just leaving
anyone who didn't show up, just to be safe.

Registering a player is very easy as long as the system knows about them - just
select their name from the dropdown list and click "Submit". You can currently add
up to 4 players at a time, and you'll end up back at the same page.

If the Player you want to add doesn't appear in the dropdown list, follow the link to
https://example.com/admin/tournament/player/add/ where you can add them. Please
do check before adding them - de-duplicating players who are in the system twice has
to be done by hand and it quite tricky! Note that email address, if provided, will
be used to send board calls to, and also to send a link to enter country preferences
if that's how Great Powers are assigned in your Tournament. The "WDD id" is used to
provide background information about the Player. The "picture" is for future use.

This is also a good time to add any SeederBias that you might need. Your Tournament
page has a link to https://example.com/admin/tournament/seederbias/add/ where you
can specify the two TournamentPlayers and the weight.

Great Power Preferences
-----------------------

If you're using preference lists to assign Great Powers, hopefully most players will
provide you with an email address. In that case, when you register them, the system
will send them an email with a unique URL where they can enter their preferences for
the Tournament. You can see which have been sent out from the tournament player page,
and you can also re-send them from here if needed.

For players who don't provide an email, you can enter their preferences by hand at
https://example.com/tournaments/42/prefs. Preferences are entered as a string of
characters, for example "FGIRT" meaning "France, then Germany, then Italy, then
Russia, then Turkey, with England and Austria joint last".

Roll Call and Game Seeding
--------------------------

Note: the software has the concept of "the current round", which is determined
by which rounds have RoundPlayers (i.e. roll call has been done) and Games that
haven't yet finished. One effect of this is that you shouldn't enter roll call
information until you're actually about to start the round (in practice, you
don't know for sure who's going to show up until then anyway).

Shortly before the Round starts, go to the round page, which should be
https://example.com/tournaments/42/current_round/
There you will find a "Roll Call" link to https://example.com/tournaments/42/rounds/1/roll_call/
Here you simply check the box by each player who is present to play the round.
Once you have everyone entered, press "Submit".
If you don't have an exact multiple of seven players, the system will prompt you to
either have players sit out the round or to have players play multiple games. Just
select them from the dropdown lists and hit "Submit".
The system will go ahead and seed the boards. Note that you can refresh this page
to re-do the seeding if needed. You can also make changes manually. Once you're happy,
press "Submit" and the Games will be created, including sending out emails to the players.

Game Tracking
-------------

How much you do here really depends on what you want to achieve. The system is designed
to allow people to follow along with the tournament as it progresses, but that obviously
means more data entry on your part than just tracking the results of games.
Your options are:
Upload images for games as they progress. Ideally every season, but gaps are ok.
Enter SupplyCentre ownership data after each game year (in this case the system will
calculate CentreCounts).
Enter CentreCounts after each game year.
For DrawProposals, you can enter all of them or just the ones that pass.

The bare minimum is the final year CentreCounts and any passed DrawProposals. These are
needed to calculate scores.

If you were to enter all the above data, people would be able to see timelapse-style
displays of the board state, charts of SC ownership and centre counts, and textual
highlights like "Austria dropped from 5 to 2, losing Trieste to Italy, Greece to Turkey,
and Budapest to Russia", as well as up-to-date "if all games ended now" scores.

Note that if you want people to be able to follow the Tournament, you'll need to set
it to "Published".

Results
-------

The system will calculate scores as games progress (it continually updates all the scores
on an "if all games ended now" basis), and will provide charts for best countries,
as well as a leaderboard.

If necessary, you can override the calculated scores. I haven't had to use this for a very
long time, though, so there may well be bugs there.

Upload to WDD
-------------

Once your Tournament is complete, the system can generate the two CSV files needed to
upload the results to the WDD.
