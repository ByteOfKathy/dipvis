Diplomacy Tournament Visualiser

Inspired by the TV coverage for sports events, the intent is to provide
something analagous for Diplomacy tournaments, whereby spectators (and
players) can follow the tournament.

It's all python code, HTML, and Django (https://www.djangoproject.com/) templates.

You can create tournaments, consisting of a numer of rounds, add players
to games, and track game, round, and tournament progress. It automatically
generates "commentary" on things like player history (it can read from the
World Diplomacy Database if given the appropiate player id), tournament history,
and game progress. When viewing a tournament, the window can be subdivided
into frames and each frame can show an aspect of a game, round, or tournament.
