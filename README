Diplomacy Tournament Visualiser

Inspired by the TV coverage for sports events, the intent was originally to
provide something analagous for Diplomacy tournaments, whereby spectators (and
players) could follow the tournament. It has evolved to be primarily a Tournament
Director aid - seeding boards, scoring tournaments, etc, although the live
tracking of scores is also used a lot by players at tournaments.

Itâ€™s been used for several tournaments already, at https://diplomacytv.com/

It's all python code, HTML, and Django (https://www.djangoproject.com/) templates.

You can create tournaments, consisting of a numer of rounds, add players
to games, and track game, round, and tournament progress. It automatically
generates "commentary" on things like player history (it can read from the
World Diplomacy Database if given the appropiate player id), tournament history,
and game progress. When viewing a tournament, the window can be subdivided
into frames and each frame can show an aspect of a game, round, or tournament.
