Assuming you have python and Django installed.

You can test out the system as follows:
0. Run migrations
   "python manage.py makemigrations"
   "python manage.py makemigrations"
1. Create a SQLite database -
   "python manage.py loaddata players"
   "python manage.py loaddata game_sets"
   It will be auto-populated with Great Powers and a few known players.
2. Create an admin account -- "python manage.py createsuperuser"
3. Run the test server - "python manage.py runserver"
3. Open the URL "http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/tournament/player/" in
   a web broswer and add players by filling in the fields.
4. Open the URL "http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/tournament/tournament/" in
   a web browser and add a tournament by filling in the fields. Optionally
   add players to the tournament. Note that adding a player to a tournament
   can take a while because the system copies information from the WDD to
   its own database. This can be avoided by not providing WDD Ids for
   TournamentPlayers.
5. Open the tournament's page "http://127.0.0.1:8000/tournaments/1/" in a
   web browser and try out some of the links.
6. Open the Roll Call URL "http://127.0.0.1:8000/tournaments/1/roll_call/"
   in a web browser and add players to one or more rounds.
   # This didn't work for me. What did work was going to
   # http://127.0.0.1:8000/tournaments/1 and clicking through from there
   # to add players. Guessing this got out of sync with updates? -Jason
   # Or it's supposed to be http://127.0.0.1:8000/tournaments/1/rounds/1/roll_call/ maybe?
7. You'll be taken to the page to create a game for the round. Go ahead and
   do that.
   # When I create a game, I get an error message, but it does populate
   # the game into the tournament. I think it's trying to send emails to
   # the players in the test game and doesn't like that it doesn't have
   # emails for them.
